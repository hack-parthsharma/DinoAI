# DinoAI
AI that plays google-chrome dino game. Using basic OpenCV image annotation and template matching.
This is my first Open-Source AI project so feel free to suggest new feautures.
# Updates Log
- [x] Clear the code
- [x] Add image annotation to display pixel value
- [x] Check if the game status is day/night
- [ ] Check pixel value and jump if needed
- [ ] Change pixel x depending on game speed

# Installation
Make sure you have python installed :)
```
git clone https://github.com/hack-parthsharma/DinoAI
```
```
cd DinoAI
```
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Usage
You will need to edit the script for your own needs. The values that you need to change, are listed in the comments located at the top of the script.\
(**After the AI is completed, I will probably add argparse to the script to make the customization easier for the users.**)\
After customizing the dino.py file, are you ready to run the bot! lets do it
```
python dino.py
```
After executing the command, go to your google-chrome dino game window and enjoy!
